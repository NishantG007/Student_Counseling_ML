# Student Counseling Predictor 🧠

![Depression Awareness](./Depressed.png)

## About the Project 🚀
This project aims to assist psychologists and university mental health professionals in the early detection of students at risk of depression. The primary goal is to create a lightweight tool for rapid mental health screening, not to replace psychologists, but to support their decision-making process and enable timely interventions. Using machine learning, the system classifies students based on risk levels derived from surveys and behaviour-related data.

## Objectives of the Project 🎯
- Develop an assistive mental health risk classification tool using machine learning.
- Provide early identification of students who may need psychological support.
- Support institutions in proactive mental health strategies.
- Ensure the solution is easy to use, scalable, and non-invasive in its application.

## Dataset Source 💿
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Student Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hopesb/student-depression-dataset)

## Tools ⚒️
- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Flask 🌐  

## Findings 📊
- High accuracy in predicting students at risk using logistic regression.
- Identification of key influencing factors contributing to student depression.
- The tool enables a simple yet effective way to screen multiple students quickly.
- Visual representation of feature importance aids in psychological interpretation.

## Conclusion 🚀
The Student Counseling Predictor is a practical tool for early mental health risk detection in academic settings. With the help of machine learning models and a Flask-based web interface, the system provides a clear, interpretable prediction of whether a student is at mental risk or not. This enables psychologists and institutions to act early, reducing the chance of long-term negative outcomes.
